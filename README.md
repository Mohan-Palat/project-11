### &#x1F535; Approach 
<ul>
<li>We went with simple but focus design that would allow us demonstrate our understanding of REACT and utilize APIs in the app. </li>

<li>We also took the approach of pair programming in development for better colloboration </li>

<li>Styling was designed under individual branch so we could put our creativity to the view using CSS, Bootstrap or 
Semantic UI React</li>
</ul>

### &#x1F535; User Stories
