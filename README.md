* As a user when I complete selecting a Base Country and Exchange Country I want to view the exchange rate for the counties that I selected.
* As a user when I select a Base Country any previous exchange rate results will be dynamically updated on page.

* Stretch - As a user when I select a Base Country and Exchange Country I want to see the flags for the countries that I selected.
